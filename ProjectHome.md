This project is a proof of concept.  Demonstrating the usability/features of the [olap4j](http://www.olap4j.org/) library.  Currently Halogen can connect to a [mondrian](http://mondrian.pentaho.org/) cube, perform simple member selections and return a resultset that is displayed in a crosstab format.

The code is being released by a small group of [Pentaho](http://www.pentaho.org) developers in hopes of it morphing into a more robust gwt/olap4j based slicer/dicer and to advance the olap4j standard as a uniform way of connecting to analysis services.
